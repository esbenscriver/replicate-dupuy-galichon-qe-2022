# Description
This project aims at replicating the empirical results of [Dupuy and Galichon (2022)](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE928) who estimates the Value of a Statistical Life using compensating wage differentials for the risk of fatal injury on the job. Using US data for 2017, they estimate the Value of Statistical Life to be $6.3 million ($2017). Their estimate relies on maximum likelihood estimation of a one-to-one matching model with transferable utility, where the demand and supply of labor is given by the logit formula.
